**Color depth**, also known as **bit depth**, is either the number of [bits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) used to indicate the [color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color) of a single [pixel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), in a [bitmapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) image or video [frame buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_buffer), or the number of bits used for each color component of a single pixel.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#cite_note-OverviewHEVCIEEE2012-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#cite_note-CodingEfficiencyHEVCIEEE2012-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#cite_note-HEVCdraft10-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#cite_note-HEVCOctober2012K0109-4) For consumer video standards, such as [High Efficiency Video Coding (H.265)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding), the bit depth specifies the number of bits used for each color component

### 24 bit per pixel and 32 bit per pixel

“24 bit” usually means 24 bits total per pixel, with 8 bits per channel for red, green and blue, or 16,777,216 total colours. This is sometimes referred to as 24 bit RGB.

“32 bit” also usually means 32 bits total per pixel, and 8 bits per channel, with an additional 8 bit alpha channel that’s used for transparency. 16,777,216 colours again. This is sometimes referred to as 32 bit RGBA.

24 bit and 32 bit can mean the same thing, in terms of possible colours. It’s also worth noting that transparency doesn’t need to be sent to your display, because displays are opaque (you can’t see through your display to what’s behind it, unless you’re Tony Stark).

### 32 bit per channel

Also, 32 bit occasionally means 32 bits per channel (128 bits total per pixel). And, a lot of the time 32 bit per channel uses floating point numbers, rather than integers.

The [OpenEXR](http://openexr.com/) format supports 32 bit float channels. That might sound excessive, but it’s often used for VFX and rendered material, where heavy processing or colour correction may be involved, and large files are less of a concern.

### 16 bit per pixel or 16 bit per channel?

“16 bit” can typically mean two different things: 16 bits per pixel *or* 16 bits per channel. 16 bits per pixel works out to be 65,536 possible colours, and it definitely looks worse than 24 bits per pixel. 16 bits per channel means 281,474,976,710,656 total colours — well beyond human perception, but handy for processing.
