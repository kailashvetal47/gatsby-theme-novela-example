# **STUPID code, seriously?¶**

This may hurt your feelings, but you have probably written STUPID code already. I have too. But, what does that mean?

In the following, I will explain the individual points with more details. This is more or less the transcript of my talk.

### **Singleton¶**

The [Singleton pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is probably the most well-known design pattern, but also the most misunderstood one. Are you aware of the *Singleton syndrome*? It is when you think the Singleton pattern is the most appropriate pattern for the current use case you have. In other words, you use it everywhere. That is definitely **not** cool.

[Singletons are controversial](https://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/wiki/WhySingletonsAreControversial), and they are often [considered anti-patterns](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11292109/why-is-singleton-considered-an-anti-pattern-in-java-world-sometimes). You should [avoid them](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/40373/so-singletons-are-bad-then-what). Actually, the use of a [singleton is not the problem, but the symptom of a problem](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/40373/so-singletons-are-bad-then-what/40376#40376). Here are two reasons why:

- Programs using global state are very difficult to test;
- Programs that rely on global state hide their dependencies.

But should you really avoid them all the time? I would say *yes* because you can often replace the use of a singleton by something better. Avoiding static things is important to avoid something called **tight coupling**.

### **Tight Coupling¶**

**Tight coupling**, also known as **strong coupling**, is a generalization of the Singleton issue. Basically, you should [reduce coupling](http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/coupling.pdf) between your modules.**Coupling** is [the degree to which each program module relies on each one of the other modules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)).

If making a change in one module in your application requires you to change another module, then coupling exists. For instance, you instantiate objects in your constructor’s class instead of passing instances as arguments. That is bad because it **doesn’t allow further changes** such as replacing the instance by an instance of a sub-class, a *mock* or whatever.

Tightly coupled modules are **difficult to reuse**, and also **hard to test**.

### **Untestability¶**

In my opinion, **testing should not be hard!** No, really. Whenever you don’t write unit tests because you don’t have time, the real issue is that your code is bad, but that is another story.

Most of the time, **untestability** is caused by **tight coupling**.

### **Premature Optimization¶**

Donald Knuth said: “*premature optimization is the root of all evil*. There is **only cost**, and **no benefit**”. Actually, optimized systems are much more complex than just rewriting a loop or using [pre-increment instead of post-increment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24886/is-there-a-performance-difference-between-i-and-i-in-c). You will just end up with unreadable code. That is why [Premature Optimization is often considered an anti-pattern](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization).

A friend of mine often says that there are two rules to optimize an application:

- don’t do it;
- (for experts only!) don’t do it yet.

### **Indescriptive Naming¶**

This should be obvious, but still needs to be said: **name** your classes, methods, attributes, and variables **properly**. Oh, and [don’t abbreviate](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/#6-don-t-abbreviate)! You write code for people, not for computers. They don’t understand what you write anyway. Computers just understand `<code class="highlighter-rouge">0` and `<code class="highlighter-rouge">1`. **Programming languages are for humans**.

### **Duplication¶**

[Duplicated code](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DuplicatedCode) is bad, so please [Don’t Repeat Yourself](http://lostechies.com/patricklioi/2013/07/30/no-seriously-dont-repeat-yourself/) ([DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't/_repeat/_yourself)), and also [Keep It Simple, Stupid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS/_principle). Be lazy the right way – write code only once!

Now that I have explained what STUPID code is, you may think that your code is STUPID. It does not matter (yet). Don’t feel bad, keep calm and be awesome by writing SOLID code instead!

# **SOLID to the rescue**

SOLID is a term describing a **collection of design principles** for good code that was invented by Robert C. Martin, also known as *Uncle Bob*.

SOLID means:

- **[S**ingle Responsibility Principle](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/#single-responsibility-principle)
- **[O**pen/Closed Principle](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/#open/closed-principle)
- **[L**iskov Substitution Principle](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/#liskov-substitution-principle)
- **[I**nterface Segregation Principle](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/#interface-segregation-principle)
- **[D**ependency Inversion Principle](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/#dependency-inversion-principle)
